C++ Linked List Implementation by Jameson Yee

Purpose:
Practice basic operations of the data struction and its operations

key functions:
Push back and front
insert
split (recursively cuts list into sublists for merge sort) 
merge sort (ascending or descending)

note: at the moment you can only test one sort function at a time. Uncomment the last line of
the split fuction (243) and the 2 lines in the drive code to test the other sort fuction.
